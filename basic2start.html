An aside can be used to represent content that is related the content surrounding it. Think of pull-quotes or snippets of related information in an article. Navigation can stand alone or in a section or aside or any other div container that you want to use to position something. You don't have to put links or other navigational elements in a navigation tag, it just looks cleaner in the code if you do.

<section>
A section element represents a more general section and could be used to split up an article, or to represent chapters, for example. You can have several articles in a section if you want. 
<article>An article element can be used to mark up a standalone section of content. This could be used just once, if you think of a blog post as an article, for example, or a number of times, if you imagine replicating a traditional newspaper page with numerous articles.

<footer>Typically there is at least one footer and it is at the end of the page. There can also be a footer tag used to control the look of elements in a section. Usually people include additional links, content info, or at least a copyright line.
